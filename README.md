### Landscaper enables the multi-dimensional analysis of machine learning loss landscapes. 

</div>

## Introduction

Landscaper offers a comprehensive framework for exploring the loss landscapes of deep learning models, encompassing three key aspects: **construction**, **quantification**, and **visualization**. It achieves this by **constructing** detailed landscape representations via high-dimensional sampling. Then, it **quantifies** them using methods like a novel TDA-based smoothness metric, offering new evaluation perspectives. Finally, Landscaper provides intuitive **visualization** tools to help users extract actionable insights, complementing traditional performance metrics for a more holistic understanding of model behavior.

## Setup
This package is managed by `uv`, you can find instructions on how to install it [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). Once it is installed, simply run `uv venv` to setup your environment.
