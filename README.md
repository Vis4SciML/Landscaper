### Landscaper enables the multi-dimensional analysis of machine learning loss landscapes. 

</div>

## Introduction

Landscaper offers a comprehensive framework for exploring the loss landscapes of deep learning models, encompassing three key aspects: \textit{construction}, \textit{quantification}, and \textit{visualization}. For construction, Landscaper employs high-dimensional sampling techniques to generate detailed representations of the loss landscape, enabling finer-grained capture of the underlying structure in the high-dimensional parameter space. For quantification, we introduce a novel smoothness metric grounded in TDA, which extracts topological features from the sampled loss surface to serve as a complementary evaluation measure beyond conventional performance metrics. Finally, for visualization, Landscaper provides a suite of intuitive visual tools that facilitate actionable insights from the constructed landscapes, addressing limitations of existing scalar metrics. These three unique components are designed to be complementary, supporting a wide range of analytical objectives to understand and evaluate ML models.
