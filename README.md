<h3>A comprehensive Python framework designed for exploring the loss landscapes of deep learning models.</h3> 

</div>

## Introduction

`Landscaper` is a comprehensive Python framework designed for exploring the loss landscapes of deep learning models. It integrates three key functionalities:

- **Construction**: Builds detailed loss landscape representations through low and high-dimensional sampling.
- **Quantification**: Applies advanced metrics, including a novel topological data analysis (TDA) based smoothness metric, enabling new insights into model behavior.
- **Visualization**: Offers intuitive tools to visualize and interpret loss landscapes, providing actionable insights beyond traditional performance metrics.

By uniting these aspects, Landscaper empowers users to gain a deeper, more holistic understanding of their model's behavior. More information can be found in the [documentation] or in the [paper].
